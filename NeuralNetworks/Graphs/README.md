These are the graphs that I couldn't fit into my report (so I could include cat pictures). "Binary" indicates that these graphs were made by the binary classification model, and "Class" indicated that the graphs were made by the 6 class model. The outputs preceeded by only by numbers, which were the number of epochs, are also results of the binary model. Some of these are included because they weren't formatted correctly when I ran the model towards the beginning of these experiments.
