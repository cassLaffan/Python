"""Binary Search Tree class.

This is the recursive implementation of a binary search tree data structure
from Week 8 of the course.

Note that this class is conceptually similar to a general tree,
but has separate left and right attributes rather than a list of trees.

This contains all of the BST methods from the week:
lecture material, labs, and the exercise.
